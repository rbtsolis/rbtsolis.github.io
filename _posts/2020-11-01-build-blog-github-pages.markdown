In this case we will start with Github Pages and we will use `Jekyll` to create a blog.

Story behind my blog:
I was thinking in create one custom blog with some Framework, pay the server, but if you think, that is too much just to build a simple blog later I choose `Jekyll`, that is awesome tool.

#### **Some point before start:**
 - We need Ruby 2.1 or higher
 - Please install Ruby or type: `ruby -v` if you have Ruby installed
 - Verify if you have Ruby Gem "Is like a dependency manager like pip, npm etc." type: `gem -v`

#### **Now we are ready to start with Jekyll**
 1. `gem install jekyll bundler`
 2. type: `jekyll -v` to verify your **Jekyll** version

#### **Creation and upload**
 1. Create a repo with your username of github in this case: yourusername.github.io
 2. Type: `jekyll new yourprojectname`
 3. Run your Jekyll project with: bundle exec jekyll serve
 4. Clone the repo and paste your content in the repo or add git remote (That is out of the purpose of this guide)

#### **Just push your code and done**
Now you're ready to start blogging
